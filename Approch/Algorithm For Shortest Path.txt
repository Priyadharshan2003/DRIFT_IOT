 # An algorithm that finds the shortest path for a vehicle in light traffic:

1.Input: A weighted graph representing the road network, the starting point, and the destination.

2.Initialize:

Create a priority queue (min heap) to store the estimated distance (sum of the edge weights) from the start to each vertex.
Create a dictionary to store the distance from the start to each vertex. Set the distance of the starting vertex to 0 and all other vertices to infinity.
Create a dictionary to store the parent of each vertex. Set the parent of the starting vertex to None.

3.While the priority queue is not empty:

Extract the vertex with the smallest estimated distance from the priority queue and mark it as visited.
For each unvisited neighbor of the current vertex:
Calculate the distance from the start to the neighbor through the current vertex.
If the new distance is less than the current distance stored in the dictionary, update the distance and the parent for the neighbor.
Push the neighbor into the priority queue with the updated estimated distance.

4.Output:

The path from the starting vertex to the destination can be reconstructed from the parent dictionary.
This algorithm is known as Dijkstra's algorithm, which is an efficient algorithm for finding the shortest path between two nodes in a graph with non-negative edge weights. The time complexity of the algorithm is O(E + V log V), where E is the number of edges and V is the number of vertices in the graph.
