# The overall working of this circuit can be explained as follows:

## A smart driving system is implemented using V2X communication, which integrates various sensors to provide various driving-related data. The data from these sensors is processed and sent to the other vehicles or a central server through the LTE module.

Let's explain the circuit logic for each of the sensors:

## GPS Neo 6M:
The GPS Neo 6M module receives data from GPS satellites and provides the current position of the vehicle in terms of latitude and longitude coordinates. The module is connected to the microcontroller through the serial communication pins, RX (D0) and TX (D1). The microcontroller reads the data from the module and processes it.

## HC SR04:
The HC SR04 is an ultrasonic sensor used for measuring the distance between the sensor and an object. The sensor has two pins, trigger (D9) and echo (D8). The microcontroller sends a trigger signal to the sensor through the trigger pin, and the sensor sends back an echo signal after reflecting off the object. The duration of the echo signal is proportional to the distance between the sensor and the object. The microcontroller measures the duration of the echo signal and calculates the distance.

## MCP2515:
The MCP2515 is a CAN (Controller Area Network) controller used to communicate with other vehicles or with a central server. The MCP2515 is connected to the microcontroller through the SPI communication pins, SCK (D13), SI (D11), SO (D12), and chip select (D10). The microcontroller communicates with the MCP2515 to send and receive data on the CAN network.

## MPU-6050:
The MPU-6050 is an accelerometer used to measure the acceleration and orientation of the vehicle. The accelerometer is connected to the microcontroller through the I2C communication pins, SCL (A5) and SDA (A4), and an interrupt pin (D4). The microcontroller communicates with the accelerometer to read the acceleration and orientation data and processes it.

## ADXL335:
The ADXL335 is an accelerometer used to measure the acceleration of the vehicle in the x, y, and z-axis. The accelerometer is connected to the microcontroller through the analog input pins, X (A0), Y (A1), and Z (A2). The microcontroller reads the analog values from the accelerometer and converts them into acceleration values.

## SIM7600:
The SIM7600 is an LTE module used to send and receive data from the other vehicles or a central server. The LTE module is connected to the microcontroller through the serial communication pins, TXD (D7) and RXD (D6). The microcontroller communicates with the LTE module to send and receive data through the LTE network.

## ROUTER :
-The router plays an important role in providing internet connectivity for the LTE module. The LTE module communicates with the other vehicles or a central server through the LTE network, but it requires an internet connection to do so. The router provides the internet connection to the LTE module by connecting to the internet service provider.

-The router acts as a gateway between the LTE module and the internet. The data received by the LTE module is transmitted to the router, and the router forwards the data to the internet, where it reaches the other vehicles or a central server. Similarly, the data received from the other vehicles or a central server is transmitted to the router, and the router forwards the data to the LTE module, which is then processed by the microcontroller.

-In short, the router acts as an intermediary that allows the LTE module to communicate with the other vehicles or a central server over the internet. Without the router, the LTE module would not be able to send and receive data through the LTE network.

## CELL TOWER :
-the cell tower plays a crucial role in providing the communication network for the LTE module. The LTE module communicates with other vehicles or a central server through the LTE network. The cell tower is the infrastructure that enables this communication by providing a network coverage area for the LTE module.

-The cell tower is responsible for transmitting and receiving data from the LTE module. When the LTE module sends data, it sends the data to the nearest cell tower. The cell tower then relays the data to the other vehicles or the central server through the LTE network. Similarly, when data is received from the other vehicles or the central server, it is transmitted to the nearest cell tower, which then relays the data to the LTE module.

-In short, the cell tower acts as the backbone of the LTE network and provides the communication infrastructure for the LTE module. Without the cell tower, the LTE module would not be able to communicate with other vehicles or the central server.

## In summary, 

all the sensors are connected to the microcontroller(Arduino), which processes the data from the sensors and communicates with other vehicles or a central server through the LTE module. The processed data can be used for various driving-related applications, such as traffic management, accident prevention, etc.
